# Manipulatives for Computer Science

**CS2Mulch** is a collection of physical manipulatives specifically
developed to improve comprehension of advanced data
structures concepts in computer science. Students can see, touch, and move the data to experience first-hand the space and time compromises inherent in information storage and retrieval.

Two original decks of cards ([Acorns]({{site.baseurl}}/tree) and
[Menagerie]({{site.baseurl}}/hash)) along with supporting chits have been designed,
tested, and refined that can form the basis for collaborative peer 
exercises.

Students can use these tools to add and 
remove elements from [binary search trees]({{site.baseurl}}/tree/insertion) 
or [heaps]({{site.baseurl}}/tree/hinsertion), understand the efficiency 
compromises of sorting algorithms such as [quicksort]({{site.baseurl}}/tree/quicksort) 
and [bubble sort]({{site.baseurl}}/tree/bubblesort), and compare hash table 
collision resolution algorithms like [linear probing]({{site.baseurl}}/hash/linear), 
and [cuckoo hashing]({{site.baseurl}}/hash/cuckoo).

CS2Mulch is available for purchase from [The Game Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/cs2mulch). These resources, along with lesson plans and supporting materials,
also freely available, either for PDF download and modification
through a Creative Commons license, or virtually through
the online board game sandbox software [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/).
