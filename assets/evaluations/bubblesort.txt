&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/noimage.png{}What is the primary purpose of the Bubble Sort algorithm?{}To merge two sorted collections.{}To perform a search on a collection.{}To sort a collection in ascending order.{}To find the maximum value in a collection.{}To sort a collection in ascending order.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/noimage.png{}In the context of Bubble Sort, why are numbers only accessed two at a time?{}To save memory.{}To prevent the algorithm from seeing the numbers.{}To emphasize the way computers use indices to access array elements.{}To make the algorithm run faster.{}To emphasize the way computers use indices to access array elements.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/ebsort1.png{}If these two numbers are the starting point, what are the next 3 steps?{}Compare, Flip down left face-up card, Flip up card to the right of the two face-up cards.{}Swap, Flip down right face-up card, Flip up card to the left of the two face-up cards.{}Flip down left face-up card, Flip up card to the left of the two face-up cards, Compare.{}Swap, Flip up card to the right of the two face-up cards, Flip down left face-up card.{}Swap, Flip up card to the right of the two face-up cards, Flip down left face-up card.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/ebsort2.png{}If these two numbers were the only swap that occurred during this pass, what is the maximum number of passes that could occur after?{}6.{}7.{}1.{}3.{}6.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/ebsort3.png{}If these two numbers are the starting point, what is necessary to flip up the entire collection?{}Apply the algorithm working from right to left.{}Compare the two face-up cards.{}No swaps occurred during this pass.{}Swap the two face-up cards.{}No swaps occurred during this pass.
