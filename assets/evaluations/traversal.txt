&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/etraversal1.png{}Which traversal of this tree ends with the largest number found in the tree?{}Preorder.{}Postorder.{}Inorder.{}Impossible to tell.{}Inorder.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/noimage.png{}What is the main difference between Postorder and Preorder traversals?{}Preorder traversals visit more numbers than Postorder.{}Preorder traversals are faster than Postorder traversals.{}Preorder visits the root of a subtree first, Postorder visits the root of a subtree last.{}Preorder visits only left subtrees first, Postorder visits only right subtrees first.{}Preorder visits the root of a subtree first, Postorder visits it last.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/etraversal3.png{}What place does 13 show up in a Postorder traversal of this tree?{}4th.{}1st.{}2nd.{}7th.{}2nd.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/etraversal4.png{}What is the Preorder traversal of this tree?{}3, 5, 6, 21, 43, 58, 69.{}69, 58, 43, 21, 6, 5, 3.{}43, 5, 3, 6, 21, 69, 58.{}3, 21, 6, 5, 58, 69, 43.{}43, 5, 3, 6, 21, 69, 58.
&{}/cs2mulch/assets/images/noimage.png{}What do Inorder traversals rely on to visit the numbers in a tree in ascending order?{}The children in a tree are always less than the parent.{}The natural ordering of children in binary search trees.{}The height of binary search trees.{}The maximum number of leaves in a tree.{}The natural ordering of children in binary search trees.
