## Overview

In *Before The Birds*, players are squirrels collecting acorns for
the winter. Players compete to collect acorns from the ground, looking
for acorns that can be **efficiently stored** and will **ripen together**.
The player with the best collection wins the game!

* 3-7 Players
* 10 Minutes

## Materials

One deck of [Acorn]({{site.baseurl}}/tree) cards.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bg.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Sample cards from the deck." %}

## Initial Setup

Shuffle the full deck of cards and **deal 9 cards** face-down to
each player. These cards will be the player's **Hand**. Players may
look at the cards in their Hand.

Turn **one card per player** face-up to
form the initial **Ground**. Sort these Ground cards, *from lowest
to highest*, and place them in a row in the middle of the table.

The remaining cards are discarded from the game.

## Rules

The game has 9 rounds, which consist of **Collection** and **Storage**.

### Collection

First, players will simultaneously and secretly select one card from their Hand to **bid** for a Ground card, placing it face-down in front of them.  When all players have selected a card, these bid cards are **revealed face-up simultaneously**.

The player who bid the *lowest* card collects the *lowest* Ground card, and must add it to their tree according to the **Storage** section rules. The player who bid the *second-lowest* card collects the *second-lowest* Ground card, etc. for each player’s bid.

As a player collects a Ground card, they should replace it in the Ground with their **bid card**. In this way, the bid cards become the Ground for the *next round*.

### Storage

Squirrels store their acorns in a peculiar way. To store an acorn in the **first** round, players place their collected card face-up in front of them.  This first card is called the **root** of their storage.

For all subsequent rounds, players **start with the root** as their *current* card and repeatedly try to find the right place to bury the collected card using the following rules:

* If the collected card is **less than** the *current* card, look at the **upper-left** corner of the *current* card. Otherwise, the collected card must be **greater than** the *current* card, so look at the **upper-right** corner of the *current* card.

* If a card is *found* where you are looking, **repeat the above step again**, with the *found* card becoming the *current* card next time around.

* Otherwise, if there is *no card* where you are looking, **place the collected card on this corner**, tilted roughly 45 degrees from the *current* card.  

Continue playing rounds until all players have empty Hands.

## Final Scoring

A player’s score is determined by two properties of their collection: the **length** of their storage, and the **time** when their acorns ripen.

* **Length**: Count the number of cards on the *longest possible path* a squirrel could take according to the Storage section.

* **Color**: The acorns are colored with seven different colors: Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow, Purple, and White. Count
the number of **different** colors in the tree.

Sum these two values, and the player with the **lowest** score is the winner!

## Scoring Example

In this collection, the player stored acorns efficiently,
but the color difference was large.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/insert9.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="How to score a collection." %}

* Length	=  4  (25 to 44 to 26 to 33)

* Color 	=  4  (Yellow, Purple, Green, Blue)

Final Score: 4 + 4 = 8

## Variants

### Game Length

Players can agree upon a **scoring limit**, such as 25 points.
Over multiple games, players accumulate points until at least
one player has earned over the scoring limit. The player with
the lowest **total** score is the winner.

### Strategy

Games with a smaller number of players can reduce the number of
cards used according to the table below.

|Players|Cards To Use|
|:--:|:--:|
|3   |00-29|
|4   |00-39|
|5   |00-49|
|6   |00-59|
|7   |00-69|

## Science Background

Research shows that squirrels actually use
[spatial chunking](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/squirrels-really-organize-nuts.htm)
to organize nuts!

The way acorns are stored in this game is called a
[binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).
Computer scientists use structures like this to efficiently store data in a program.
